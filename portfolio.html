					<p>
						After finding a career as a financial advisor unfulfilling, I decided I wanted to change careers to do something that required more problem solving and creativity.  So I quit my job, started a painting business, and decided to go back to school for computer science.  After a year of computer science, I learned some foundational theory, algorithms, and math, but wanted things to move a bit faster.  That's when I found Coding Dojo and learned about their immersive 3 month program in web development.  My time at Coding Dojo has provided me hands on experience in building end-to-end web applications in three full stacks.  I have found my passion in creating, and am always striving to learn all I can in this vast field.

					End-to-end data analysis application.  Allows a user to create a profile, enter in meals (including ingredients) they have eaten.  Upon a food intolerance reaction, they can select the type of reaction and severity which then queries the database for the most recent meal eaten and assigns a reaction to its associated ingredients.  The User can analyze the data via a table of all ingredients consumed by the user and their frequency for causing reactions, allowing the user to pinpoint what exactly makes them sick.  Worked in team of two.
